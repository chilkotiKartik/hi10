Song: "Someone Like You" by Adele
Intro/Verse Chords: A - E/G# - F#m - D - A - E/G# - F#m - D - A
Chorus Chords: E - F#m - D - A - E - F#m - D - A
Bridge Chords: F#m - D - A - E
    `,
    solution: `
Key: A major
Chord Functions:
- A: I (Tonic)
- E/G#: V (Dominant with 3rd in bass)
- F#m: vi (Submediant)
- D: IV (Subdominant)
- E: V (Dominant)

The progression follows a common I-V-vi-IV pattern that creates a strong emotional pull. The use of the E/G# inversion creates a smooth bass line movement. The chorus emphasizes the dominant-tonic relationship with the E to A resolution.

Issues in the mix:
- Vocals seem buried at times
- Bass and kick drum lack definition
- Overall mix sounds muddy
- Stereo image feels narrow
- Cymbals are harsh
    `,
    solution: `
Mixing Improvements:
1. Vocals: Apply a gentle 2-3dB boost around 2-3kHz to improve clarity. Use automation to bring up quieter passages.
2. Bass/Kick: Apply high-pass filter to other instruments below 100Hz to clear mud. Use sidechain compression on bass when kick hits.
3. Muddy mix: Cut frequencies around 200-300Hz on multiple tracks where mud accumulates. Add high-shelf boost around 10kHz for air.
4. Stereo image: Use stereo widening on overhead drums and background elements. Keep bass, kick, and vocals centered.
5. Harsh cymbals: Apply a de-esser or dynamic EQ around 6-8kHz to tame harshness. Consider a gentle low-pass filter above 16kHz.

Chord Progression (in C major):
C - Am - F - G - C - Am - Dm - G

Style: Emotional film theme
Tempo: Moderately slow (around 80 BPM)
Instrumentation: Piano or orchestral
    `,
    solution: `
Melody Composition Approach:
1. Start on the root (C) to establish the key
2. Use longer notes (half notes, dotted quarters) to create an emotional quality
3. Create an arch shape with the melody (rising, then falling)
4. Include a distinctive motif that repeats with variation
5. Use passing tones and suspensions over chord changes for tension
6. Resolve to the tonic at the end for closure
7. Consider using the 6th scale degree (A) over the C chord for a bittersweet quality
8. Add a chromatic approach tone before the final G chord for drama

Student Age: 8-10 years old
Previous Knowledge: Basic understanding of quarter and half notes
Learning Objectives: Introduce eighth notes and basic rhythmic patterns
Available Resources: Classroom percussion instruments, piano, whiteboard
    `,
    solution: `
45-Minute Rhythm Lesson Plan:

1. Warm-up (5 minutes):
   - Echo clapping patterns using quarter and half notes
   - Body percussion sequence to engage students physically

2. Introduction to Eighth Notes (10 minutes):
   - Visual representation on whiteboard (compare to quarter notes)
   - Counting system: "1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &"
   - Teacher demonstration on piano or percussion

3. Guided Practice (15 minutes):
   - Group echo clapping with eighth note patterns
   - "Pass the rhythm" circle game with increasing complexity
   - Simple rhythm reading from whiteboard notation

4. Application Activity (10 minutes):
   - Small groups create 4-beat rhythm patterns using cards
   - Groups perform their patterns for the class
   - Combine patterns to create a class composition

5. Assessment & Closure (5 minutes):
   - Individual quick-checks: teacher plays, student identifies
   - Review key concepts about eighth notes
   - Preview next lesson on combining note values

Extensions:
- Add simple lyrics to rhythm patterns
- Incorporate movement for kinesthetic learners
- Connect to familiar songs that use eighth notes

Performance: Female vocalist performing a pop ballad
Observations:
- Strong head voice in chorus
- Some pitch issues in the bridge
- Occasional breathiness in lower register
- Good emotional expression
- Runs sound somewhat uncontrolled
    `,
    solution: `
Vocal Technique Analysis:

Strengths:
1. Head voice/upper register shows good resonance and control
2. Emotional connection to lyrics comes through clearly
3. Phrasing choices serve the song well
4. Tone color variations add interest to repeated sections

Areas for Improvement:
1. Pitch accuracy in bridge: Likely due to challenging intervals and register shifts. Recommend targeted interval practice and slow, deliberate practice with piano.
2. Lower register breathiness: Suggests need for better breath support. Recommend diaphragmatic breathing exercises and focused practice on lower range with proper support.
3. Vocal runs control: Runs sound improvised rather than planned. Recommend practicing runs slowly with metronome, gradually increasing speed until each note is distinct and intentional.
4. Dynamic contrast: Could use more variation between verses and chorus. Recommend mapping out dynamic plan for emotional build.

Technical exercises to address these issues:
- Sirens for register transitions
- Staccato exercises for breath support
- Slow-to-fast scale patterns for run precision
- Targeted pitch-matching exercises for the bridge section
